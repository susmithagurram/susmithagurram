# Visionary

Greetings, fellow earthlings! I'm Susmitha Gurram, currently on a mission to harness technology for the greater good as I pursue my Master's in Information Systems at George Mason University. I believe in a future where tech solves our biggest challenges, like climate change and the mystery of why printers never work when you need them most. Join me on this adventure, where failure is just a plot twist and success is the ultimate punchline!

# Student Engagement Officer

At George Mason University, I work as a Student Engagement Officer, where I manage a portfolio of local constituents, encouraging them to reconnect with the university. I communicate the strategic vision of George Mason, ensuring that our innovative programs support and advance our vibrant student and alumni community. My role involves connecting with individuals through various channels, from emails to face-to-face meetings, and collaborating with colleagues to keep our community thriving.

# Community Soresress

In 2023, I swapped my cape for a wizard's hat and became a Community Manager at Simba Exchange and Blazpay. I conjured communities of over 300k users, using the magic of blockchain and community psychology.

From November 2022 to July 2023, I moonlighted as a Contributor and Community Outreach specialist at Shardeum. Picture me as a blockchain bard, spreading the gospel of Web 3.0 to over 1000 students across 10+ colleges.

# Software Engineer (CyberSecurity SOC Analyst)

My first mission was at Tata Consultancy Services as a CyberSecurity SOC Analyst. Picture this: me, cape flowing (metaphorically, of course), battling cyber villains to protect data with tools like Qrador and Crowdstrike. I led a team of 11 brave souls, ensuring that no byte was left unprotected. Java and Python were my trusty sidekicks, while Oracle and MySQL kept our databases in line.

# Journey

My journey into the tech cosmos began with a Bachelor's in Technology from Malla Reddy Engineering College, where I learned to speak fluent Python and Javaâ€”languages that computers understand better than humans, but hey, that's the point! As a student volunteer, I was part of the National Service Scheme, developing my personality through community service and working with Engineers Hub, the world's largest youth tech conference.

# GOAL : Establish a successful tech business by leveraging innovative technologies and market opportunities.Enhance coding skills and stay updated with emerging tech trends.
Continuously learn and adapt to drive business growth and sustainability.
